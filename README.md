# PROBLEM STATEMENT
Implement a queue using an array and perform the following operations:<br>
1. Enqueue: Add an element to the rear of the queue.<br>
2. Dequeue: Remove and return the element from the front of the queue.<br>
3. Peek: Return the element at the front of the queue without removing it.<br>
4. isEmpty: Check if the queue is empty.<br>
5. isFull: Check if the queue is full.<br>Ensure that your queue has a maximum capacity specified when initializing it.<br><br>

# EXAMPLE<br>
For example, given a queue with a capacity of 5, perform the following operations:<br>
1. Enqueue elements 10, 20, 30 into the queue.<br>
2. Dequeue an element from the queue.<br>
3. Enqueue elements 40, 50 into the queue.<br>
4. Peek at the front element.<br>
5. Check if the queue is empty.<br>
6. Check if the queue is full.<br>
Write a program to simulate these operations and display the state of the queue after each operation.
